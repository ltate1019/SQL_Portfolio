#In this project customers sales data was looked into for different months throughout the year. 
#Counted the total sales made in Janurary:
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> "Order ID"; 

#Counted the total sales made in Janurary for iPhones:
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> "Order ID" 
AND product = "iPhone";

#Selected the customer account numbers for all orders placed in February:
SELECT DISTINCT C.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers C
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales F
ON F.orderID = C.order_ID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> "Order ID";

#Selected the price and cheapest product sold in Janurary:
SELECT Product, MIN(price) AS cheapest_product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

#Calculated the total revenue per product sold in Janurary:
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity) * price,2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product; 

#Selected the product, quantity, and total revenue per product sold at a distinct location: 
SELECT Product,
SUM(Quantity) AS total_sold,
ROUND(SUM(Quantity) * price,2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

#Selected the customer account number, and calculated the average spent per account in February: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.acctnum), ROUND(AVG(F.Quantity * F.price),2) AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales F
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers C
ON F.orderID = C.order_id
